# Portfolio Mock-Up

## Description

This webpage is a portfolio of the work that I will complete as the bootcamp continues.  It is to showcase
my work so that possible future employers can see what skills I have in Front-End Web Development, and will
help them decide to employee me.
It was implemented using HTML5 and CSS3, with the layout comprising of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, to make it
responsive.

The most challenging parts for me were using CSS Grid, maybe I should not have used a combination of Grid and Flexbox
throughout the site, maybe I should have stuck to one or the other.  When using media queries to make the page
responsive for smaller screens, I found that sections started behaving strangely, moving, shrinking and growing,
I then started trying to sort these issues out, trying to see what was wrong with the CSS to make this happen.
At one point I decided to stop looking into this and carry on with the rest of the media queries for the page.
Once I had finished the media queries, everything was ok, everything was where it should have been.  So one thing
I have learnt is to wait until I've completed the media queries and then look into anything that is not behaving
as I want it to, this will save a lot of wasted time.

Other issues were with determining sizes of everything to match the mock image provided.  Having a different display
size creates issues with how it should be displayed, so I opted for using vh units to determine the size based
on the display size.

As I complete more projects, I will add them to my portfolio page, replacing the ones that are currently there 
as placeholders.  I will also add in a photo of myself at a later date.

##  Installation

The portfolio can be found at [Nick Misselbrook Portfolio](https://nickmbk.github.io/portfolio/)

## Usage

At the top of the page you will find my name and links to each section of the page.  The Resume link doesn't currently work 
as I need to build a page that will display my resume.

The About Me section explains a little about myself, my background and why I have become a Web Developer.

Under Work I have displayed the spaces that will contain my projects that will showcase what I can do.
When I add my projects to this section, they will be clickable and take you to the deployed project site.

You can find all my contact details in the Contact Me section at the bottom of the page.
